A personal multi-purpose bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/ "Discord's Homepage") written in C# using the [Discord .NET library](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net).

## Origins
DuckyBot was initially inspired by a friend going by the alias "Ducky" who happened to make a lot of questionable statements. Brainstorming a way to archive what he said I got the idea to make a Discord bot, as this way it could randomly post what hes said, and there could also be the feature to dynamically add to the list of things to post. These ideas of features grew and grew until eventually DuckyBot outgrew its originally envisioned purpose and began to be more of a generic bot full of widely appreciated and accepted features, albeit with its still existing crude commands that started it off.
## Features
 DuckyBot has been in ongoing development for about a year and a half and has garnered a lot of features in that time, such as:-

* **Random text posting (locally stored and through various APIs)**
* **Random image posting (locally stored and through various APIs)**
* **Fitting reactions to user messages (under set conditions)**
* **Dynamic text updating functionality**
* **Ability to re-format/manipulate entered user text**
* **Fully fledged turn based combat game for 2 users**
* **Timer functionality**
* **User levelling system**
* **Persistent data**
* **Advanced moderation capabilities**

I plan to add even more features and flesh out existing ones as time goes on, but DuckyBot is only a hobby so any progress may take some time.
